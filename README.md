# SPA-Router-band-landing-page

A small exercise to react-router

Please create a small React app for your favorite music band.  
Your navigation should contain as many items as the members of your band (4+ members. We all love Daft Punk but we need more routes).  
Use the [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) package to handle your navigation.  
Your solution doesn't have to have any transitions by default.

#### BONUS

You can experiment with transitions between pages as well. Here are some interesting libraries:
